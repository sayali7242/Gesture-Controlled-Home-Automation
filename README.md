# Gesture-Controlled-Home-Automation
Modern smart home assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri) aim
at providing increased comfort to humans through automated operations.
However, they rely heavily on voice commands for real-time
smart home control. Unfortunately, being restricted to using voice
commands or complicated user interfaces to trigger such devices
makes such interactions difficult for people with speech impairments,
elderly people who find it hard to remember commands, or
novice users. Through Lumos, we propose a gesture-based input
device in a portable form factor to aid elderly and disabled people.
Using a combination of inertial measurement with an accelerometer
and gyroscope and motion tracking using an infrared (IR) camera,
we demonstrate the design of a system that can accept gestures as
inputs.

Using the AWS IoT core interface, we link identified gestures
to smart home devices to allow for a more intuitive and seamless
control. Our solution is quicker in nature as people won’t have
to wait for smart assistant’s response to a vocal trigger and more
intuitive than using tedious smartphone applications. Most importantly,
this enables simple smart- home interactivity for people with
speech-impediments, or disabilities that otherwise prevent them
from interacting with smart-assistants conventionally.
